#The project will be over profiling. We, a group of three, will use cinebench and GPU-z to find out which cores are being used, which are doing the heavy lifting, and how to make sense of parallel and communication between the cores. The test samples will be our laptops, we will not only do compare and contrasting, but figure out why some laptops' cores perform better the other cores.

# Parallel-Project
# Hello and welcome to the Parallel Project. We don't have a concrete idea yet, so this is going to be a placeholder for now. I will come back to this and change it when our idea is cemented.
